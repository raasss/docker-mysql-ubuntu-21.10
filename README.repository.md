# Introduction

MySQL Server is one of the most popular open source relational databases. Itâ€™s made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source. It is part of most cloud offerings and the default in most Linux distributions. ([more info](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/))

# Quickstart guide

Starting a mysql instance with the latest version is simple via [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose). If you don't have docker-compose tool installed, please go [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and follow instractions.

Example `docker-compose.yml` for `mysql`:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

networks:
  private:
    driver: bridge

services:
  mysql:
    image: raasss/mysql-ubuntu-21.10:latest
    networks:
      - private
    ports:
      - "3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_SERVER_CONF_1=mysqld:key_buffer_size:16M
      - MYSQL_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:slow_query_log:1
      - MYSQL_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:long_query_time:2
      - MYSQL_SERVER_CONF_2=mysqld:log_queries_not_using_indexes:1
```

In your current working directory create `docker-compose.yml` file.

Run docker-compose and services should be up soon:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

We can find port where mysql service listen for connections like this:

```console
$ docker-compose port mysql 3306
0.0.0.0:49154
```

In this example we can configure any mysql client with host `0.0.0.0:49154`.

# Advance guide

## Container shell access

The `docker-compose exec` command allows you to run commands inside a Docker container.

The following command line will give you a bash shell inside your `mysql` container as root:

```console
$ docker-compose exec mysql bash
```

## Access logs

The log is available through Docker's container log:

```console
$ docker-compose logs mysql -f
```

You can omit `-f` if you don't want to tail logs in realtime.

## Customizing via environment variables

Customization of `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf` file in docker image is implemented.

This file is standard configuration files in INI format. Every INI file is consisted of `<section>` and `<key> = <value>` pairs.

This is how trimmed version of `php.ini` file looks like:

```ini
[mysqld]
#
# * Fine Tuning
#
key_buffer_size		= 16M
max_allowed_packet	= 64M
thread_stack		= 256K

#
# * Logging and Replication
#
# Both location gets rotated by the cronjob.
#
# Log all queries
# Be aware that this log type is a performance killer.
general_log_file        = /var/log/mysql/query.log
general_log             = 0

#
# Here you can see queries with especially long duration
slow_query_log		= 1
slow_query_log_file	= /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
long_query_time = 2
log-queries-not-using-indexes = on
```

Here we can see 1 sections `mysqld` and multiple `key=value` pairs:

- `key_buffer_size = 16M`
- `slow_query_log = 1`
- `long_query_time = 2`
- `log-queries-not-using-indexes = on`

To configure files above you need to add environment variables in format `MYSQL_SERVER_CONF_*`.

Value of these environment variables need to be in format `<section>:<key>:<value>` as can be found in example `docker-compose.yml` file above.

## Pull service images
```console
docker-compose pull
```

## Backup database inside docker to local filesystem
```console
docker-compose exec -u root mysql mysqldump --add-drop-database --add-drop-table --single-transaction --verbose mydatabase > mydatabase.sql
```

## Restore database from local filesystem to docker
```console
cat mydatabase.sql | docker-compose exec -T -u root mysql mysql mydatabase
```

## Start services
```console
docker-compose start
```

## List containers
```console
docker-compose ps
```

## Create and start containers
```console
docker-compose up -d
```

## Stop services
```console
docker-compose stop
```

## Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
```console
docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```
